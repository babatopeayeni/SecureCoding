# Green Pace Security Policy and Secure Coding Project
**Course:** CS 405 - Secure Coding  

## Project Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for the CS 405 Secure Coding projects, including security policies, project presentations, journals, and supporting documentation. The project focuses on developing secure coding practices, threat mitigation strategies, and secure development lifecycle implementation using a defense in depth approach.

## Files Included
- **Presentation:**
  - ` Contains the Green Pace Security Policy presentation, threat matrix, secure coding principles, encryption policies, and unit testing results.

- **Script:**
  - `Babatope_Ayeni_CS405_Script.docx`  
    Detailed script for the narrated presentation covering all slides, including threat assessment, secure coding standards, DevSecOps integration, and identified security gaps.

- **Journals:**
  - `Journal_Consider_Motive.docx`  
    Reflection on the importance of understanding an attackerâ€™s motive in secure coding and how this mindset improves defensive programming.
  - `Secure Coding Journal.docx`  
    Discusses why security should be embedded early in the development process and provides steps for integrating security throughout the software lifecycle.

- **Security Policies:**
  - `CS 405 Security Policy.docx`  
    Secure development policy guide, detailing core security principles, C/C++ coding standards, defense in depth, encryption, and authentication policies.
  - `Project 1-CS 405 Security Policy.docx`  
    Detailed security policy document with specific coding standards, risk assessments, encryption strategies, and auditing policies.
  - `Project 1-CS 405 Security Policy.pdf`  
    PDF version of the Project One security policy document for easier sharing and reference.
